# Tacitus on Germany

Description of customs and differences between different German peoples
We can learn a lot about how Romans saw Germans
Tacitus admired bravery of Germans
Some of their traits he despised, like drunkedness
It's written in an interesting way, the style of writing is more concise than that of Herodotes on Egypt
