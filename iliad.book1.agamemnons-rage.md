# The rage of Agamemnon against Achylles

Achylles was right, there was an actual problem that Agamemnon was the reason of, but the latter couldn't admit his fault and accept the consequences. He was afraid to acknowledge it to lose the psychological leadership to Achylles whom he envied and hated

This lead to severe consequences again. Many achaeans were killed as a result of his pride that caused animosity with Achylles and his revenge, which also was very wrong of course.

I see him as cowardly and not a mature leader. The leader must accept his fault and admit his mistakes even if it can weaken his reputation. The consequences of not admitting it are far worse.

Perhaps the relationships with Achylles would even improve, because such a step would cause others to respect Agamemnon, including his rivals.


He wants to punish the prophet too for his words, derogatorily speaking of him and blaming him.

He also says that Achylles is guilty of disrespect. Itâ€™s a bad thing, disrespect,ut what Agamemnon did was much worse. The problem with strong people and natural leaders is often the lack of humility

What Homwr wants to teach us?

Perhaps, humility and also, that leaders are people and can be immature, though great. We have to be careful with waking their anger, because their bad decisions can be very destructive
