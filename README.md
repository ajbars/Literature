My study of Cassical Western Literature by Harvard Cassics and other great book sources, more or less in form of zettelkasten, that I am learning right now

What is the Harvard Classics?

"a 50-volume series of classic works of world literature, important speeches, and historical documents compiled and edited by Harvard University President Charles W. Eliot.[1][2] Eliot believed that a careful reading of the series and following the eleven reading plans included in Volume 50 would offer a reader, in the comfort of the home, the benefits of a liberal education, entertainment and counsel of history's greatest creative minds" Wikipedia

Basically, a compendium of what should a cultural Western man know as it was seen in early XX-th centilury.
